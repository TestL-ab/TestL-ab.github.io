description: A snapshot of the current A/B Testing landscape.

Despite the challenges of A/B testing, there are multiple solutions that have emerged to help businesses conduct effective experiments.

## A/B Testing Options

Existing solutions for A/B testing run the gamut. There are bare-bones apps exposing APIs for creating and retrieving experiments from the command line. In addition, there are many What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) options for performing A/B testing on client-side-rendered applications that can be used with limited developer expertise (e.g., VWO). At the other end of the spectrum are full featured A/B testing solutions that offer exposed APIs as well as SDKs for both server-side and client-side rendered applications that require significant developer expertise.

Options for A/B testing solutions that are open source with self-hosting options are relatively few â€“ applications that look promising either have little to no development or engagement over time or they become fully-featured enterprise options that offer only expensive, managed solutions (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Optimizely).
